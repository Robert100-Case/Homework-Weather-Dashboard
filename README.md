# Homework-Weather-Dashboard
this program searches on a text field when a city in the U.S. is entered and displays the days weather. I tried to display a 5 day forecast also
but only could manage the dates, wasn't able to access the forecast api fields. Displayed buttons for previous searches but didn't have the time to make them functional.
